# IndianColleges_Dashboard
🎓 College Data Visualization Dashboard (Power BI)
🧠 Project Overview :-
This project focuses on building a data visualization dashboard using Power BI to analyze a mega dataset of colleges from multiple states across India.
The main goal was to make huge amounts of information — like college names, locations, and contact details — easy to explore and understand through interactive visuals.

The dashboard turns raw Excel data into meaningful insights, helping users quickly identify college distribution, district coverage, and communication readiness. 📊✨
